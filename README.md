# Lit Html Editor

Rich text editor built with [Lit](https://lit.dev) based on [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Editable_content#example_a_simple_but_complete_rich_text_editor) example.

You can try the demo [here](https://rodydavis.github.io/lit-html-editor/)!

This used the contenteditable property that browsers support for full document editing and text formatting.
